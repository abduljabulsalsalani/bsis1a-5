            <div class="text-section">
            <p class="banner-text">Chugong wrote the South Korean web book Solo Leveling, which was eventually turned into an anime and a webtoon (manhwa). The narrative centers on Sung Jin-Woo, a low-ranking and feeble hunter in a world where monster-filled dungeon portals have formed out of nowhere, forcing humanity to struggle for existence.
            </p>
            <h2 class="title1">PLOT SUMMARY</h2>
            <p class="banner-text">
                Hunters in this world are those who have developed superhuman skills to battle monsters.  The weakest hunter, Jin-Woo, is an E-ranker who barely makes it through low-level dungeons to provide for his family.  He and his group stumble upon a death trap when they enter an enigmatic twin dungeon one day.  Jin-Woo is given a peculiar mechanism that enables him to level up, which is unprecedented in this universe, while he faces certain death.
 With the help of this "player system," Jin-Woo starts to get stronger at an astonishing rate, picking up new skills, talents, and potent weaponry.  As he advances through the ranks, he learns more about the hunters, the dungeons, and the enigmatic forces in charge of everything.
